# GitHub Trending Repos Terminal Application on Google Cloud

- Google Cloud account
- Google Cloud SDK installed and authenticated
- GitHub account

1. Open the Google Cloud Console.
2. Navigate to the "Compute Engine" section.
3. Click on "Create Instance" to create a new VM.
4. Choose the appropriate operating system, machine type, and other settings for your application.
5. Enable the necessary firewall rules to allow incoming HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
6. Create the VM instance.

1. Connect to the VM via SSH.
gcloud compute ssh --zone=[ZONE] [VM_NAME]

2. Update the package manager and install Nginx.
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y nginx

3. Install Node.js and npm.
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

4. Install the required dependencies for the application.
npm install jquery
npm install jquery.terminal
npm install d3
npm install marked

**Global Search**: Allow users to search across the repository name, description, programming language, and other metadata. This can be achieved by building a search index and using a library like Lunr.js or Elasticlunr.js.

**Faceted Filtering**: Provide a set of filters, such as programming language, stars, forks, and last updated, that users can combine to narrow down the list of trending repositories. These filters can be implemented using JavaScript and manipulating the DOM to show/hide relevant repositories.

**Autosuggestions**: As the user types in the search input, display a list of autocomplete suggestions to help them find relevant repositories more efficiently. This can be done by making AJAX requests to fetch suggestions from the search index.

**Highlighting and Excerpts**: When displaying search results, highlight the matched terms and provide excerpts of the repository description to give users a quick overview. This can be achieved using regular expressions and string manipulation.

**Live Updates**: Automatically update the visualizations when new trending data becomes available, without requiring a full page refresh. This can be done using a combination of polling, WebSockets, or Server-Sent Events.

**Animated Transitions**: Use D3.js's built-in transition functions to create smooth animations when the data or visualization changes. This will provide a more engaging user experience.

**Responsive Resizing**: Ensure the visualizations resize and adapt gracefully when the user resizes the browser window or changes the layout. This can be achieved using CSS media queries and D3.js's responsive design techniques.

**Interactivity**: Allow users to interact with the visualizations, such as by clicking on a specific repository to display more details or to open the repository in a new tab. This can be implemented using event handlers and DOM manipulation.

1. Create the directory structure for the application.
mkdir -p /var/www/my-app/css /var/www/my-app/js /var/www/my-app/lib

2. Copy the application files to the VM.
   - You can use `scp` or `rsync` to transfer the files from your local machine to the VM.
   - Alternatively, you can set up a Git repository and clone it on the VM.

3. Configure Nginx to serve the application.
sudo vim /etc/nginx/conf.d/my-app.conf
Add the following content to the configuration file:
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    root /var/www/my-app;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}

4. Reload the Nginx configuration.
sudo nginx -s reload

1. Install the GitHub CLI.
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install github-cli

2. Authenticate with GitHub.
gh auth login

3. Create a new GitHub repository.
gh repo create my-app

4. Push the application files to the new repository.
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
